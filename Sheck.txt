Once upon a time there was a lovely
princess. But she had an enchantment 
upon her of a fearful sort which could 
only be broken by love's first kiss. 
She was locked away in a castle guarded 
by a terrible firebreathing dragon. 
Many brave knights had attempted to 
free her from this dreadful prison, 
but non prevailed. She waited in the 
dragon's keep in the highest room of 
the tallest tower for her true love 
and true love's first kiss. laughs 
Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
a load of  toilet flush
Allstar  by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
after the ogre.
NIGHT  NEAR 'S HOME MAN1
Think it's in there? MAN2
All right. Let's get it! MAN1
Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
thing can do to you?
MAN3
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
bread.
Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs. 
Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
They'll make a suit from your freshly 
peeled skin.
MEN
No! 
They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
quite good on toast.
MAN1
Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
waves the torch at Shrek.
Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
men are in the dark.
This is the part where you run away. 
The men scramble to get away. He laughs. 
And stay out! looks down and picks 
up a piece of paper. Reads. Wanted. 
Fairy tale creatures.He sighs and 
throws the paper over his shoulder.
THE NEXT DAY There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
little pigs.
GUARD
All right. This one's full. Take it 
away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
HEAD GUARD
Next! GUARD
taking the witch's broom Give me that! 
Your flying days are over. breaks the 
broom in half
HEAD GUARD
That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
Next!
GUARD
Get up! Come on! HEAD GUARD
Twenty pieces. LITTLE BEAR
crying This cage is too small. 
Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
Give me another chance!
OLD WOMAN
Oh, shut up. jerks his rope 
Oh! HEAD GUARD
Next! What have you got? GIPETTO
This little wooden puppet. PINOCCHIO
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. his 
nose grows
HEAD GUARD
Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
Take it away.
PINOCCHIO
Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
Help me!
Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
to the table.
HEAD GUARD
Next! What have you got? OLD WOMAN
Well, I've got a talking donkey. HEAD GUARD
Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
if you can prove it.
OLD WOMAN
Oh, go ahead, little fella. Donkey just looks up at her. HEAD GUARD
Well? OLD WOMAN
Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
HEAD GUARD
That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
OLD WOMAN
No, no, he talks! He does. pretends 
to be Donkey I can talk. I love to 
talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
you ever saw.
HEAD GUARD
Get her out of my sight. OLD WOMAN
No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
Hey! I can fly! PETER PAN
He can fly! 3 LITTLE PIGS
He can fly! HEAD GUARD
He can talk! 
Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
a flying, talking donkey. You might 
have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
fly. Ha, ha! the pixie dust begins 
to wear off Uhoh. he begins to sink 
to the ground.
He hits the ground with a thud. HEAD GUARD
Seize him! Donkey takes of running. 
After him!
GUARDS
He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
Turn!
Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
quickly hides behind Shrek.
HEAD GUARD
You there. Ogre! 
Aye? HEAD GUARD
By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
to place you both under arrest and transport 
you to a designated resettlement facility.
Oh, really? You and what army? He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
begins walking back to his cottage.
Can I say something to you? Listen, 
you was really, really, really somethin' 
back here. Incredible!
Are you talkin' to...he turns around 
and Donkey is gone me? he turns back 
around and Donkey is right in front 
of him. Whoa!
Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
you that you that you was great back 
here? Those guards! They thought they 
was all of that. Then you showed up, 
and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
like babes in the woods. That really 
made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really. 
Man, it's good to be free. 
Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
stick with you. You're mean, green, 
fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
the spit out of anybody that crosses 
us.
Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
loudly.
Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
work, your breath certainly will get 
the job done, 'cause you definitely 
need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
you breath stinks! You almost burned 
the hair outta my nose, just like the 
time...Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
his hand. ...then I ate some rotten 
berries. I had strong gases leaking 
out of my butt that day.
Why are you following me? 
I'll tell you why. singing 'Cause 
I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
me, My problems have all gone, There's 
no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
faith...
Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
have any friends.
Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
cruelly honest.
Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
me. What am I?
looks all the way up at Shrek Uh ...really 
tall?
No! I'm an ogre! You know. Grab your 
torch and pitchforks. Doesn't that 
bother you?
Nope. 
Really? 
Really, really. 
Oh.
Man, I like you. What's you name? 
Uh, Shrek. 
Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
you, Shrek? You got that kind of Idon'tcarewhatnobodythinksofme 
thing. I like that. I respect that, 
Shrek. You all right. They come over 
a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage. 
Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
in place like that?
That would be my home. 
Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
You know you are quite a decorator. 
It's amazing what you've done with such 
a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
don't entertain much, do you?
I like my privacy. 
You know, I do too. That's another thing 
we have in common. Like I hate it when 
you got somebody in your face. You've 
trying to give them a hint, and they 
won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
awkward silence Can I stay with you?
Uh, what? 
Can I stay with you, please? 
sarcastically Of course! 
Really? 
No. 
Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
You don't know what it's like to be 
considered a freak. pause while he 
looks at Shrek Well, maybe you do. 
But that's why we gotta stick together. 
You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
Okay! Okay! But one night only. 
Ah! Thank you! he runs inside the cottage
What are you...? Donkey hops up onto 
a chair. No! No!
This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
Oh! 
Where do, uh, I sleep? 
irritated Outside! 
Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
I don't know you, and you don't know 
me, so I guess outside is best, you 
know. Here I go. Good night. Shrek 
slams the door. sigh I mean, I do 
like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
no one here beside me...
'S COTTAGE  NIGHT Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
noise. He stands up with a huff.
to Donkey I thought I told you to 
stay outside.
from the window I am outside. There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
BLIND MOUSE1
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
farm, but what choice do we have?
BLIND MOUSE2
It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
GORDO
bouncing on a slug What a lovely bed.
Got ya. Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
and lands on his shoulder.
GORDO
I found some cheese. bites Shrek's 
ear
Ow! GORDO
Blah! Awful stuff. BLIND MOUSE1
Is that you, Gordo? GORDO
How did you know? 
Enough! he grabs the 3 mice What are 
you doing in my house? He gets bumped 
from behind and he drops the mice. 
Hey! he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
with Snow White on the table. Oh, no, 
no, no. Dead broad off the table.
DWARF
Where are we supposed to put her? The 
bed's taken.
Huh? Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
him.
BIG BAD WOLF
What? TIME LAPSE Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
him to the front door.
I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
do get a little privacy? He opens the 
front door to throw the Wolf out and 
he sees that all the collected Fairy 
Tale Creatures are on his land. Oh, 
no. No! No!
The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
What are you doing in my swamp? this 
echoes and everyone falls silent.
Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
tent.
All right, get out of here. All of you, 
move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! more 
dwarves run inside the house No, no! 
No, no. Not there. Not there. they 
shut the door on him Oh! turns to 
look at Donkey
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
them.
PINOCCHIO
Oh, gosh, no one invited us. 
What? PINOCCHIO
We were forced to come here. 
flabbergasted By who? LITTLE PIG
Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
and he...signed an eviction notice.
heavy sigh All right. Who knows where 
this Farquaad guy is?
Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers. 
Oh, I do. I know where he is. 
Does anyone else know where to find 
him? Anyone at all?
Me! Me! 
Anyone? 
Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
Me, me!
sigh Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
Your welcome is officially worn out. 
In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
right now and get you all off my land 
and back where you came from! Pause. 
Then the crowd goes wild. Oh! to Donkey 
You! You're comin' with me.
All right, that's what I like to hear, 
man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
friends, off on a whirlwind bigcity 
adventure. I love it!
singing On the road again. Sing it 
with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
on the road again.
What did I say about singing? 
Can I whistle? 
No. 
Can I hum it? 
All right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'. DULOC  KITCHEN A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
That's enough. He's ready to talk.
The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
and plays with them Run, run, run, 
as fast as you can. You can't catch 
me. I'm the gingerbread man.
You are a monster. 
I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
me! Where are the others?
Eat me! He spits milk into Farquaad's 
eye.
I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
Now my patience has reached its end! 
Tell me or I'll...he makes as if to 
pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons
No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
buttons.
All right then. Who's hiding them?
Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
muffin man?
The muffin man? 
The muffin man. 
Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
on Drury Lane?
Well, she's married to the muffin man.
The muffin man? 
The muffin man! 
She's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in. HEAD GUARD
My lord! We found it. 
Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
it in.
More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
Mirror.
in awe Ohhhh... 
Magic mirror... 
Don't tell him anything! Farquaad picks 
him up and dumps him into a trash can 
with a lid. No!
Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
of them all?
MIRROR
Well, technically you're not a king.
Uh, Thelonius. Thelonius holds up a 
hand mirror and smashes it with his 
fist. You were saying?
MIRROR
What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
But you can become one. All you have 
to do is marry a princess.
Go on. MIRROR
chuckles nervously So, just sit back 
and relax, my lord, because it's time 
for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
And here they are! Bachelorette number 
one is a mentally abused shutin from 
a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
include cooking and cleaning for her 
two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
shows picture of Cinderella Bachelorette 
number two is a capewearing girl from 
the land of fancy. Although she lives 
with seven other men, she's not easy. 
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
find out what a live wire she is. Come 
on. Give it up for Snow White! shows 
picture of Snow White And last, but 
certainly not last, bachelorette number 
three is a fiery redhead from a dragonguarded 
castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
But don't let that cool you off. She's 
a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! Shows

be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
number two or bachelorette number three?
GUARDS
Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!
Three? One? Three? THELONIUS
Three! holds up 2 fingers Pick number 
three, my lord!
Okay, okay, uh, number three! MIRROR
Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
Fiona.
Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
have to do is just find someone who 
can go...
MIRROR
But I probably should mention the little 
thing that happens at night.
I'll do it. MIRROR
Yes, but after sunset... 
Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
your finest men. We're going to have 
a tournament. smiles evilly
DuLoc Parking Lot  Lancelot Section Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
But that's it. That's it right there. 
That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
Uhhuh. That's the place. 
Do you think maybe he's compensating 
for something? He laughs, but then 
groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
He continues walking through the parking 
lot.
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek. MAN
Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
Hey, you! The attendant, who is wearing 
a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
screams and begins running through the 
rows of rope to get to the front gate 
to get away from Shrek. Wait a second. 
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
I just   He sighs and then begins 
walking straight through the rows. The 
attendant runs into a wall and falls 
down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
continue on into DuLoc.
DULOC They look around but all is quiet. 
It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
Hey, look at this! Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
to sing.
WOODEN PEOPLE
Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
Here we have some rules Let us lay them down Don't make waves, stay in line And we'll get along fine DuLoc is perfect place Please keep off of the grass Shine your shoes, wipe your... face DuLoc is, DuLoc is DuLoc is perfect place. Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture. 
Wow! Let's do that again! makes ready 
to run over and pull the lever again
grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still 
No. No. No, no, no! No.
They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena. 
Brave knights. You are the best and 
brightest in all the land. Today one 
of you shall prove himself...
As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
All right. You're going the right way 
for a smacked bottom.
Sorry about that. 
That champion shall have the honor  
no, no   the privilege to go forth 
and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
the first runnerup will take his place 
and so on and so forth. Some of you 
may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
to make. cheers Let the tournament 
begin! He notices Shrek Oh! What is 
that? It's hideous!
turns to look at Donkey and then back 
at Farquaad Ah, that's not very nice. 
It's just a donkey.
Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
kills the ogre will be named champion! 
Have it him!
MEN
Get him! 
Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. bumps 
into a table where there are mugs of 
beer
CROWD
Go ahead! Get him! 
holds up a mug of beer Can't we just 
settle this over a pint?
CROWD
Kill the beast! 
No? All right then. drinks the beer 
Come on!
He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
to say that Shrek kicks butt.
Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
Yeah! A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
and sees him.
WOMAN
The chair! Give him the chair! Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
the veal! Ha, ha! laughs
The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on 
Shrek.
HEAD GUARD
Shall I give the order, sir? 
No, I have a better idea. People of 
DuLoc, I give you our champion!
What? 
Congratulations, ogre. You're won the 
honor of embarking on a great and noble 
quest.
Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest 
to get my swamp back.
Your swamp? 
Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those 
fairy tale creatures!
Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you 
a deal. Go on this quest for me, and 
I'll give you your swamp back.
Exactly the way it was? 
Down to the last slimecovered toadstool.
And the squatters? 
As good as gone. 
What kind of quest? Time Lapse  Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field 
heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
Let me get this straight. You're gonna 
go fight a dragon and rescue a princess 
just so Farquaad will give you back 
a swamp which you only don't have because 
he filled it full of freaks in the first 
place. Is that about right?
You know, maybe there's a good reason 
donkeys shouldn't talk.
I don't get it. Why don't you just pull 
some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle 
him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
his bones to make your bread, the whole 
ogre trip.
Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have 
decapitated an entire village and put 
their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
cut open their spleen and drink their 
fluids. Does that sound good to you?
Uh, no, not really, no. 
For your information, there's a lot 
more to ogres than people think.
Example? 
Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
he holds out his onion
sniffs the onion They stink? 
Yes   No! 
They make you cry? 
No! 
You leave them in the sun, they get 
all brown, start sproutin' little white 
hairs.
No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres 
have layers! Onions have layers. You 
get it? We both have layers. he heaves 
a sigh and then walks off
trailing after Shrek Oh, you both 
have layers. Oh. Sniffs} You know, 
not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody 
loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
I don't care... what everyone likes. 
Ogres are not like cakes.
You know what else everybody likes? 
Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, 
you say, Let's get some parfait, they 
say, Hell no, I don't like no parfait? 
Parfaits are delicious.
No! You dense, irritating, miniature 
beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! 
And of story. Byebye. See ya later.
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing 
on the whole damn planet.
You know, I think I preferred your humming.
Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
making a mess. Just the word parfait 
make me start slobbering.
They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
DRAGON'S KEEP Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
sniffs Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
You gotta warn somebody before you just 
crack one off. My mouth was open and 
everything.
Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
be dead. sniffs It's brimstone. We 
must be getting close.
Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
about it's the brimstone. I know what 
I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
didn't come off no stone neither.
They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
foreboding.
Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
location. laughs...then the laugh turns 
into a groan
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
ogres have layers?
Oh, aye. 
Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
wear our fear right out there on our 
sleeves.
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
You know what I mean. 
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
about being on a rickety bridge over 
a boiling like of lava!
Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
just tackle this thing together one 
little baby step at a time.
Really? 
Really, really. 
Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
Just keep moving. And don't look down.
Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
look down. he steps through a rotting 
board and ends up looking straight down 
into the lava Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
off, please!
But you're already halfway. 
But I know that half is safe! 
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
You go back.
Shrek, no! Wait! 
Just, Donkey   Let's have a dance 
then, shall me? bounces and sways the 
bridge
Don't do that! 
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? bounces 
the bridge again
Yes, that! 
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. continues to 
bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
the bridge
No, Shrek! No! Stop it! 
You said do it! I'm doin' it. 
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
I'm gonna die. steps onto solid ground 
Oh!
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. walks 
towards the castle
Cool. So where is this firebreathing 
painintheneck anyway?
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
chuckles
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
INSIDE THE CASTLE 
You afraid? 
No. 
But... 
Shh. 
Oh, good. Me neither. sees a skeleton 
and gasps 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
response to an unfamiliar situation. 
Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
and eats knights and breathes fire, 
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
if you're a little scared. I sure as 
heck ain't no coward. I know that.
Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
Now go over there and see if you can 
find any stairs.
Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
the princess.
putting on a helmet The princess will 
be up the stairs in the highest room 
in the tallest tower.
What makes you think she'll be there?
I read it in a book once. walks off
Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
won't know which way they're goin'. 
walks off
EMPTY ROOM Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
the stair master. I've mastered the 
stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
I'd step all over it.
ELSEWHERE Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window. 
Well, at least we know where the princess 
is, but where's the...
os Dragon! Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
breathes fire.
Donkey, look out! he manages to get 
a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
on Got ya!
The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
on the floor.
Oh! Aah! Aah! Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small 
part of the bridge he's on.
No. Oh, no, No! the dragon roars Oh, 
what large teeth you have. the dragon 
growls I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
I know you probably hear this all time 
from your food, but you must bleach, 
'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
freshness? And you know what else? You're 
You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
at him What's the matter with you? 
You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
but you know, I'm, uh...the dragon 
blows a smoke ring in the shape of a 
heart right at him, and he coughs I'm 
an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
rings. Shrek! the dragon picks him 
up with her teeth and carries him off 
No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
'S ROOM Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
and shakes her away.
Oh! Oh! 
Wake up! 
What? 
Are you Princess Fiona? 
I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to 
rescue me.
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go! 
But wait, Sir Knight. This beith our 
first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, 
romantic moment?
Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should 
sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
You've had a lot of time to plan this, 
haven't you?
smiles Mmhmm. Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down 
the hallway.
But we have to savor this moment! You 
could recite an epic poem for me. A 
ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
I don't think so. 
Can I at least know the name of my champion?
Uh, Shrek. 
Sir Shrek. clears throat and holds 
out a handkerchief I pray that you 
take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks! Suddenly they hear the dragon roar. 
surprisedYou didn't slay the dragon?
It's on my todo list. Now come on! 
takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
him.
But this isn't right! You were meant 
to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
That's what all the other knights did.
Yeah, right before they burst into flame.
That's not the point. Shrek suddenly 
stops and she runs into him. Oh! Shrek 
ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
off to the side. Wait. Where are you 
going? The exit's over there.
Well, I have to save my ass. 
What kind of knight are you? 
One of a kind. opens the door into 
the throne room
os Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
I believe it's healthy to get to know 
someone over a long period of time. 
Just call me oldfashioned. laughs 
worriedly we see him up close and 
from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
the room I don't want to rush into 
a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
Magnitude really is the word I'm 
looking for. Magnitude  Hey, that 
is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
back up a little and take this one step 
at a time. We really should get to know 
each other first as friends or pen pals. 
I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
receiving cards   I'd really love 
to stay, but   Don't do that! That's 
my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
What are you gonna do with that? 
Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
No, no, no. No! Oh!
Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
Hi, Princess! 
It talks! 
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
the trick.
They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
off and walks lightly.
Oh! Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
take care of the dragon.
Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
is still around the dragons neck.
echoing Run! They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
sliding down the 'volcano' hill You 
did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
behind her Donkey falls down the hill 
You're   You're wonderful. You're... 
turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
hill and bump into Donkey a little 
unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
eternally in your debt. Donkey clears 
his throat. And where would a brave 
knight be without his noble steed?
I hope you heard that. She called me 
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
The battle is won. You may remove your 
helmet, good Sir Knight.
Uh, no. 
Why not? 
I have helmet hair. 
Please. I would'st look upon the face 
of my rescuer.
No, no, you wouldn't   'st. 
But how will you kiss me? 
What? to Donkey That wasn't in the 
job description.
Maybe it's a perk. 
No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
how it goes. A princess locked in a 
tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
by a brave knight, and then they share 
true love's first kiss.
Hmm? With Shrek? You think  Wait. 
Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
love?
Well, yes. Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing. 
You think Shrek is your true love!
What is so funny? 
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
Now   Now remove your helmet.
Look. I really don't think this is a 
good idea.
Just take off the helmet. 
I'm not going to. 
Take it off. 
No! 
Now! 
Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
takes off his helmet
You  You're a  an ogre. 
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
an ogre.
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
wants to marry you.
Then why didn't he come rescue me?
Good question. You should ask him that 
when we get there.
But I have to be rescued by my true 
love, not by some ogre and his  his 
pet.
Well, so much for noble steed. 
You're not making my job any easier.
I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
waiting for him right here.
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
right? ominous I'm a delivery boy. 
he swiftly picks her up and swings 
her over his shoulder like she was a 
sack of potatoes
You wouldn't dare. Put me down! 
Ya comin', Donkey? 
I'm right behind ya. 
Put me down, or you will suffer the 
consequences! This is not dignified! 
Put me down!
WOODS A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
Okay, so here's another question. Say 
there's a woman that digs you, right, 
but you don't really like her that way. 
How do you let her down real easy so 
her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
get burned to a crisp and eaten?
You just tell her she's not your true 
love. Everyone knows what happens when 
you find your...Shrek drops her on 
the ground Hey! The sooner we get to 
DuLoc the better.
You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
It's beautiful!
And what of my groomtobe? Lord Farquaad? 
What's he like?
Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
he and Donkey laugh
Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
the dust and grime.
I don't know. There are those who think 
little of him. they laugh again Fiona: 
Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
just jealous you can never measure up 
to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
But I'll let you do the measuring 
when you see him tomorrow.
looks at the setting sun Tomorrow? 
It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
to make camp?
No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
going.
But there's robbers in the woods. 
Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
to sound good.
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
we're going to see in this forest.
I need to find somewhere to camp now!
Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
MOUNTAIN CLIFF Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
Hey! Over here. 
Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
don't think this is fit for a princess.
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
a few homey touches.
Homey touches? Like what? he hears 
a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
who has torn the bark off of a tree.
A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
good night. goes into the cave and 
puts the bark door up behind her
You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
I will.
os I said good night! Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
still inside.
Shrek, What are you doing? 
laughs I just  You know   Oh, 
come on. I was just kidding.
LATER THAT NIGHT Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
to Donkey.
And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
the only ogre to ever spit over three 
wheat fields.
Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
from these stars?
The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
famous for.
I know you're making this up. 
No, look. There he is, and there's the 
group of hunters running away from his 
stench.
That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
dots.
You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
heaves a big sigh Hey, Shrek, what 
we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
Our swamp? 
You know, when we're through rescuing 
the princess.
We? Donkey, there's no we. There's 
no our. There's just me and my swamp. 
The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
a tenfoot wall around my land.
You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
deep just now. You know what I think? 
I think this whole wall thing is just 
a way to keep somebody out.
No, do ya think? 
Are you hidin' something? 
Never mind, Donkey. 
Oh, this is another one of those onion 
things, isn't it?
No, this is one of those dropit and 
leaveit alone things.
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Why do you want to talk about it? 
Why are you blocking? 
I'm not blocking. 
Oh, yes, you are. 
Donkey, I'm warning you. 
Who you trying to keep out? 
Everyone! Okay? 
pause Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
grins
At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
Oh! For the love of Pete! gets up and 
walks over to the edge of the cliff 
and sits down
What's your problem? What you got against 
the whole world anyway?
Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
okay? It's the world that seems to have 
a problem with me. People take one look 
at me and go. Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
stupid, ugly ogre! They judge me before 
they even know me. That's why I'm better 
off alone.
You know what? When we met, I didn't 
think you was just a big, stupid, ugly 
ogre.
Yeah, I know. 
So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small 
and Annoying.
Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny 
one, right there. That one there?
Fiona puts the door back. 
That's the moon. 
Oh, okay. DuLoc  Farquaad's Bedroom The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
show her to me. Show me the princess.
MIRROR
Hmph. The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
Ah. Perfect. Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
at her image in the mirror.
MORNING Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
in his sleep.
quietly Mmm, yeah, you know I like 
it like that. Come on, baby. I said 
I like it.
Donkey, wake up. shakes him 
Huh? What? 
Wake up. 
What? stretches and yawns 
Good morning. Hm, how do you like your 
eggs?
Oh, good morning, Princess! Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them. 
What's all this about? 
You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
rescue me.
Uh, thanks. Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips. 
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
of us. walks off
LATER They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
forest. Shrek belches.
Shrek! 
What? It's a compliment. Better out 
than in, I always say. laughs
Well, it's no way to behave in front 
of a princess.
Fiona belches 
Thanks. 
She's as nasty as you are. 
chuckles You know, you're not exactly 
what I expected.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
before you get to know them.
She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
a tree.
ROBIN HOOD
La liberte! Hey! 
Princess! 
to Robin Hood What are you doing?
ROBIN HOOD
Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
And I am rescuing you from this green...kisses 
up her arm while Fiona pulls back in 
disgust...beast.
Hey! That's my princess! Go find you 
own!
ROBIN HOOD
Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
little busy here?
getting fed up Look, pal, I don't 
know who you think you are!
ROBIN HOOD
Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
laughs
Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
MERRY MEN
Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo. ROBIN HOOD
I steal from the rich and give to the 
needy.
MERRY MEN
He takes a wee percentage, ROBIN HOOD
But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
damsels, man, I'm good.
MERRY MEN
What a guy, Monsieur Hood. ROBIN HOOD
Break it down. I like an honest fight 
and a saucy little maid...
MERRY MEN
What he's basically saying is he likes 
to get...
ROBIN HOOD
Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
MERRY MEN
That's bad. ROBIN HOOD
When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
me awfully mad.
MERRY MEN
He's mad, he's really, really mad.
ROBIN HOOD
I'll take my blade and ram it through 
your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
'cause I'm about to start...
There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
Man, that was annoying! Shrek looks at her in admiration. MERRY MAN
Oh, you little  shoots an arrow at 
Fiona but she ducks out of the way
The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
midair to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
and Fiona begins walking away.
Uh, shall we? 
Hold the phone. drops Donkey and begins 
walking after Fiona Oh! Whoa, whoa, 
whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come 
from?
What? 
That! Back there. That was amazing! 
Where did you learn that?
Well...laughs when one lives alone, 
uh, one has to learn these things in 
case there's a...gasps and points 
there's an arrow in your butt!
What? turns and looks Oh, would you 
look at that? he goes to pull it out 
but flinches because it's tender
Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so 
sorry.
walking up Why? What's wrong? 
Shrek's hurt. 
Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, 
Shrek's gonna die.
Donkey, I'm okay. 
You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm 
too young for you to die. Keep you legs 
elevated. Turn your head and cough. 
Does anyone know the Heimlich?
Donkey! Calm down. If you want to help 
Shrek, run into the woods and find me 
a blue flower with red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on 
it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die 
Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay 
away from the light!
&amp; 
Donkey! 
Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. 
runs off
What are the flowers for? 
like it's obvious For getting rid 
of Donkey.
Ah. 
Now you hold still, and I'll yank this 
thing out. gives the arrow a little 
pull
jumps away Ow! Hey! Easy with the 
yankin'.
As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and 
Shrek keeps dodging her hands.
I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
No, it's tender. 
Now, hold on. 
What you're doing is the opposite of 
help.
Don't move. 
Look, time out. 
Would you...grunts as Shrek puts his 
hand over her face to stop her from 
getting at the arrow Okay. What do 
you propose we do?
ELSEWHERE Donkey is still looking for the special flower. 
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, 
red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. 
This would be so much easier if I wasn't 
colorblind! Blue flower, red thorns.
os Ow! 
Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! rips a 
flower off a nearby bush that just happens 
to be a blue flower with red thorns
THE FOREST PATH 
Ow! Not good. 
Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. 
Shrek grunts as she pulls It's just 
about...
Ow! Ohh! he jerks and manages to fall 
over with Fiona on top of him
Ahem. 
throwing Fiona off of him Nothing 
happend. We were just, uh  
Look, if you wanted to be alone, all 
you had to do was ask. Okay?
Oh, come on! That's the last thing on 
my mind. The princess here was just 
Fiona pulls the arrow out Ugh! he 
turns to look at Fiona who holds up 
the arrow with a smile Ow!
Hey, what's that? nervous chuckle 
That's...is that blood?
Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue 
on their way.
There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to DuLoc. 
Shrek crawling up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a 
small brook so that Fiona won't get wet. Shrek then gets up as 
Donkey is just about to cross the tree and the tree swings back 
into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swatting 
and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb 
that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it 
around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins 
eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. 
Shrek catching a toad and blowing it up like a balloon and presenting 
it to Fiona. Fiona catching a snake, blowing it up, fashioning 
it into a balloon animal and presenting it to Shrek. The group 
arriving at a windmill that is near DuLoc.
WINDMILL 
There it is, Princess. Your future awaits 
you.
That's DuLoc? 
Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks 
Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, 
which I think means he has a really...Shrek 
steps on his hoof Ow!
Um, I, uh  I guess we better move 
on.
Sure. But, Shrek? I'm   I'm worried 
about Donkey.
What? 
I mean, look at him. He doesn't look 
so good.
What are you talking about? I'm fine.
kneels to look him in the eyes That's 
what they always say, and then next 
thing you know, you're on your back. 
pause Dead.
You know, she's right. You look awful. 
Do you want to sit down?
Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.
I didn't want to say nothin', but I 
got this twinge in my neck, and when 
I turn my head like this, look, turns 
his neck in a very sharp way until his 
head is completely sideways Ow! See?
Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.
I'll get the firewood. 
Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't 
feel my toes! looks down and yelps 
I don't have any toes! I think I need 
a hug.
SUNSET Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while 
Fiona eats.
Mmm. This is good. This is really good. 
What is this?
Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style. 
No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
Well, they're also great in stews. Now, 
I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean 
weed rat stew. chuckles
Fiona looks at DuLoc and sighs. 
I guess I'll be dining a little differently 
tomorrow night.
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp 
sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff 
for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare 
you name it.
smiles I'd like that. They smiles at each other. 
Um, Princess? 
Yes, Shrek? 
I, um, I was wondering...are you...sighs 
Are you gonna eat that?
chuckles Man, isn't this romantic? 
Just look at that sunset.
jumps up Sunset? Oh, no! I mean, it's 
late. IIt's very late.
What? 
Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on 
here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't 
you?
Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. 
You know, I'd better go inside.
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to 
be afraid of the dark, too, until  
Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of 
the dark.
Shrek sighs 
Good night. 
Good night. Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks 
at Shrek with a new eye.
Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on 
here.
Oh, what are you talkin' about? 
I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm 
an animal, and I got instincts. And 
I know you two were diggin' on each 
other. I could feel it.
You're crazy. I'm just bringing her 
back to Farquaad.
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell 
the pheromones. Just go on in and tell 
her how you feel.
I  There's nothing to tell. Besides, 
even if I did tell her that, well, you 
know   and I'm not sayin' I do 'cause 
I don't   she's a princess, and I'm 
An ogre? 
Yeah. An ogre. 
Hey, where you goin'? 
To get... move firewood. sighs Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already 
is.
TIME LAPSE Donkey opens the door to the Windmill and walks in. Fiona is 
nowhere to be seen.
Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, 
where are you? Princess?
Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her.
It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing 
no games.
Suddenly Fiona falls from the railing. She gets up only she doesn't 
look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking 
out.
Aah! 
Oh, no! 
No, help! 
Shh! 
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! 
No, it's okay. It's okay. 
What did you do with the princess?
Donkey, I'm the princess. 
Aah! 
It's me, in this body. 
Oh, my God! You ate the princess. to 
her stomach Can you hear me?
Donkey! 
still aimed at her stomach Listen, 
keep breathing! I'll get you out of 
there!
No! 
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! 
Shh. 
Shrek! 
This is me. Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets 
down.
Princess? What happened to you? You're, 
uh, uh, uh, different.
I'm ugly, okay? 
Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 
'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a 
bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. 
Now  
No. I   I've been this way as long 
as I can remember.
What do you mean? Look, I ain't never 
seen you like this before.
It only happens when sun goes down. 
By night one way, by day another. This 
shall be the norm... until you find 
true love's first kiss... and then take 
love's true form.
Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know 
you wrote poetry.
It's a spell. sigh When I was a little 
girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every 
night I become this. This horrible, 
ugly beast! I was placed in a tower 
to await the day my true love would 
rescue me. That's why I have to marry 
Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun 
sets and he sees me like this. begins 
to cry
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, 
it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. 
Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. 
But you only look like this at night. 
Shrek's ugly 247.
But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this 
is not how a princess is meant to look.
Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry 
Farquaad?
I have to. Only my true love's kiss 
can break the spell.
But, you know, um, you're kind of an 
orge, and Shrek   well, you got a 
lot in common.
Shrek? OUTSIDE Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his 
hand.
to himself Princess, I   Uh, how's 
it going, first of all? Good? Um, good 
for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower 
and thought of you because it's pretty 
and   well, I don't really like it, 
but I thought you might like it 'cause 
you're pretty. But I like you anyway. 
I'd   uh, uh...sighs I'm in trouble. 
Okay, here we go.
He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey 
and Fiona talking.
os I can't just marry whoever I want. 
Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, 
really, who can ever love a beast so 
hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly 
don't go together. That's why I can't 
stay here with Shrek.
Shrek steps back in shock. 
os My only chance to live happily 
ever after is to marry my true love.
Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks 
away.
INSIDE 
Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how 
it has to be. It's the only way to break 
the spell.
You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
No! You can't breathe a word. No one 
must ever know.
What's the point of being able to talk 
if you gotta keep secrets?
Promise you won't tell. Promise! 
All right, all right. I won't tell him. 
But you should. goes outside I just 
know before this is over, I'm gonna 
need a whole lot of serious therapy. 
Look at my eye twitchin'.
Fiona comes out the door and watches him walk away. She looks 
down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back 
inside the windmill.
MORNING Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still 
awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.
I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, 
I tell him not. I tell him. she quickly 
runs to the door and goes outside Shrek! 
Shrek, there's something I want...she 
looks and sees the rising sun, and as 
the sun crests the sky she turns back 
into a human.
Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards 
her.
Shrek. Are you all right? 
Perfect! Never been better. 
I   I don't   There's something 
I have to tell you.
You don't have to tell me anything, 
Princess. I heard enough last night.
You heard what I said? 
Every word. 
I thought you'd understand. 
Oh, I understand. Like you said, Who 
could love a hideous, ugly beast?
But I thought that wouldn't matter to 
you.
Yeah? Well, it does. Fiona looks at 
him in shock. He looks past her and 
spots a group approaching. Ah, right 
on time. Princess, I've brought you 
a little something.
Farquaad has arrived with a group of his men. He looks very regal 
sitting up on his horse. You would never guess that he's only 
like 3 feet tall. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the soldiers 
march by.
What'd I miss? What'd I miss? spots 
the soldiers muffled Who said that? 
Couldn't have been the donkey.
Princess Fiona. 
As promised. Now hand it over. 
Very well, ogre. holds out a piece 
of paper The deed to your swamp, cleared 
out, as agreed. Take it and go before 
I change my mind. Shrek takes the paper 
Forgive me, Princess, for startling 
you, but you startled me, for I have 
never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
I'm Lord Farquaad.
Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. Farquaad 
snaps his fingers Forgive me, my lord, 
for I was just saying a short... Watches 
as Farquaad is lifted off his horse 
and set down in front of her. He comes 
to her waist. farewell.
Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have 
to waste good manners on the ogre. It's 
not like it has feelings.
No, you're right. It doesn't. Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless 
Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. 
Will you be the perfect bride for the 
perfect groom?
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would 
make  
interrupting Excellent! I'll start 
the plans, for tomorrow we wed!
No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get 
married today before the sun sets.
Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. 
The sooner, the better. There's so much 
to do! There's the caterer, the cake, 
the band, the guest list. Captain, round 
up some guests! a guard puts Fiona 
on the back of his horse
Faretheewell, ogre. Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to DuLoc. Donkey watches 
them go.
Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting 
her get away.
Yeah? So what? 
Shrek, there's something about her you 
don't know. Look, I talked to her last 
night, She's  
I know you talked to her last night. 
You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if 
you two are such good friends, why don't 
you follow her home?
Shrek, I   I wanna go with you. 
I told you, didn't I? You're not coming 
home with me. I live alone! My swamp! 
Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! 
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, 
talking donkeys!
But I thought   
Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! 
stomps off
Shrek. Montage of different scenes. Shrek arriving back home. Fiona 
being fitted for the wedding dress. Donkey at a stream running 
into the dragon. Shrek cleaning up his house. Fiona eating dinner 
alone. Shrek eating dinner alone.
'S HOME Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes 
outside to investigate.
Donkey? Donkey ignores him and continues 
with what he's doing. What are you 
doing?
I would think, of all people, you would 
recognize a wall when you see one.
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed 
to go around my swamp, not through it.
It is around your half. See that's your 
half, and this is my half.
Oh! Your half. Hmm. 
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. 
I did half the work. I get half the 
booty. Now hand me that big old rock, 
the one that looks like your head.
Back off! 
No, you back off. 
This is my swamp! 
Our swamp. 
grabs the tree branch Donkey is working 
with Let go, Donkey!
You let go. 
Stubborn jackass! 
Smelly ogre. 
Fine! drops the tree branch and walks 
away
Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through 
with you yet.
Well, I'm through with you. 
Uhuh. You know, with you it's always, 
Me, me, me! Well, guess what! Now 
it's my turn! So you just shut up and 
pay attention! You are mean to me. You 
insult me and you don't appreciate anything 
that I do! You're always pushing me 
around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so 
bad, how come you came back?
Because that's what friends do! They 
forgive each other!
Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive 
you... for stabbin' me in the back! 
goes into the outhouse and slams the 
door
Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, 
onion boy, you're afraid of your own 
feelings.
os Go away! 
There you are , doing it again just 
like you did to Fiona. All she ever 
do was like you, maybe even love you.
os Love me? She said I was ugly, a 
hideous creature. I heard the two of 
you talking.
She wasn't talkin' about you. She was 
talkin' about, uh, somebody else.
opens the door and comes out She wasn't 
talking about me? Well, then who was 
she talking about?
Uhuh, no way. I ain't saying anything. 
You don't wanna listen to me. Right? 
Right?
Donkey! 
No! 
Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? sigh 
I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, 
stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?
Right. Friends? 
Friends. 
So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
What are you asking me for? Why don't 
you just go ask her?
The wedding! We'll never make it in 
time.
Hahaha! Never fear, for where, there's 
a will, there's a way and I have a way. 
whistles
Suddenly the dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so 
they can climb on.
Donkey? 
I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
They both laugh. 
Aw, come here, you. gives Donkey a 
noogie
All right, all right. Don't get all 
slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All 
right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't 
had a chance to install the seat belts 
yet.
They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for DuLoc. DULOC  CHURCH Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. 
The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
PRIEST
People of DuLoc, we gather here today 
to bear witness to the union....
eyeing the setting sun Um PRIEST
...of our new king... 
Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead 
to the I do's?
chuckles and then motions to the priest 
to indulge Fiona Go on.
COURTYARD Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with 
a boom. The guards all take off running.
to Dragon Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. 
If we need you, I'll whistle. How about 
that? she nods and goes after the guards 
Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You 
wanna do this right, don't you?
at the Church door What are you talking 
about?
There's a line you gotta wait for. The 
preacher's gonna say, Speak now or 
forever hold your peace. That's when 
you say, I object!
I don't have time for this! 
Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen 
to me! Look, you love this woman, don't 
you?
Yes. 
You wanna hold her? 
Yes. 
Please her? 
Yes! 
singing James Brown style Then you 
got to, got to try a little tenderness. 
normal The chicks love that romantic 
crap!
All right! Cut it out. When does this 
guy say the line?
We gotta check it out. INSIDE CHURCH As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the 
windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
PRIEST
And so, by the power vested in me...
Outside 
What do you see? 
The whole town's in there. Inside PRIEST
I now pronounce you husband and wife...
Outside 
They're at the altar. Inside PRIEST
...king and queen. Outside 
Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
Oh, for the love of Pete! He runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.
INSIDE CHURCH 
running toward the alter I object!
Shrek? The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek. 
Oh, now what does he want? 
to congregation as he reaches the front 
of the Church Hi, everyone. Havin' 
a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first 
of all. Very clean.
What are you doing here? 
Really, it's rude enough being alive 
when no one wants you, but showing up 
uninvited to a wedding...
Fiona! I need to talk to you. 
Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little 
late for that, so if you'll excuse me 
But you can't marry him. 
And why not? 
Because  Because he's just marring 
you so he can be king.
Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
He's not your true love. 
And what do you know about true love?
Well, I   Uh   I mean   
Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen 
in love with the princess! Oh, good 
Lord. laughs
The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The 
whole congregation laughs.
An ogre and a princess! 
Shrek, is this true? 
Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, 
my love, we're but a kiss away from 
our happily ever after. Now kiss me! 
puckers his lips and leans toward her, 
but she pulls back.
looking at the setting sun By night 
one way, by day another. to Shrek 
I wanted to show you before.
She backs up and as the sun sets she changes into her ogre self. 
She gives Shrek a sheepish smile.
Well, uh, that explains a lot. Fiona 
smiles
Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! 
I order you to get that out of my sight 
now! Get them! Get them both!
The guards run in and separate Fiona and Shrek. Shrek fights 
them.
No, no! 
Shrek! 
This hocuspocus alters nothing. This 
marriage is binding, and that makes 
me king! See? See?
No, let go of me! Shrek! 
No! 
Don't just stand there, you morons.
Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh! 
I'll make you regret the day we met. 
I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll 
beg for death to save you!
No, Shrek! 
hold a dagger to Fiona's throat And 
as for you, my wife...
Fiona! 
I'll have you locked back in that tower 
for the rest of your days! I'm king!
Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles. 
I will have order! I will have perfection! 
I will have   Donkey and the dragon 
show up and the dragon leans down and 
eats Farquaad Aaaah! Aah!
All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon 
here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
The dragon roars. I'm a donkey on 
the edge!
The dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth 
and falls to the ground.
Celebrity marriages. They never last, 
do they?
The congregation cheers. 
Go ahead, Shrek. 
Uh, Fiona? 
Yes, Shrek? 
I   I love you. 
Really? 
Really, really. 
smiles I love you too. Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 
'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.
CONGREGATION
Aawww! Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted 
up into the air and she hovers there while the magic works around 
her.
WHISPERS
Until you find true love's first kiss 
and then take love's true form. Take 
love's true form. Take love's true form.
Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell 
and then is slowly lowered to the ground.
going over to her Fiona? Fiona. Are 
you all right?
standing up, she's still an ogre Well, 
yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed 
to be beautiful.
But you ARE beautiful. They smile at each other. 
chuckles I was hoping this would be 
a happy ending.
Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into... THE SWAMP ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm 
a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek 
and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting 
carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet 
which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end 
up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet 
instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now 
has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona 
walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over 
singing the song.
God bless us, every one. 
as he's done singing and we fade to 
black Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't 
breathe. I can't breathe.
THE END
